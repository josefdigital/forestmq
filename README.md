### Quick Start
Forest MQ is still in very early stages of development, but
it is usable for test projects. 

As it's missing some fundamental networking security & stability requirements,
it's not recommended for production environments.

To test Forest MQ end to end you can run the following 2 Python scripts:

- `examples/python/provider.py`
- `examples/python/consumer.py`

This will demonstrate that the message queue excepts messages 
pushed in over HTTP to the queue & the consumer script will
pop messages off the queue.
