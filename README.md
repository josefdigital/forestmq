### Quick Start
#### Run with Docker
```
docker run -p 8005:8005 bandnoticeboard/forestmq:0.4.0 -d
```

Forest MQ is still in very early stages of development, but
it is usable for test projects. 

As it's missing some fundamental networking, security & stability requirements,
it's not recommended for production environments.

To test Forest MQ end to end you can run the following 2 Python scripts:

- `examples/python/provider.py`
- `examples/python/consumer.py`

This will demonstrate that the message queue excepts messages 
enqueued over HTTP to the queue & the consumer script will
dequeue messages off the queue.


### CLI options
| Arg           | Info                                        | Example             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `--msg-size`  | integer e.g                                 | `--msg-size 1024`   |
| `--port`      | integer e.g                                 | `--port 3000`       |
| `--log-level` | Default is `none` (No logging)              | `--log-level none`  |    
|               | Debugging level logging (includes all logs) | `--log-level debug` |
| `--daemon`    | Run ForestMQ in daemon mode                 | `--daemon`          |

### Options
#### Provider Options:
- `message` - A string, bytes or JSON object.
- `destroy` - If set to `true` then the queue will be destroyed & no more messages
will be stored on the queue until the `destroy: true` options is removed from the provider's
request body or set to `false`.

### Environment Variables

### Health
To check the health of a running ForestMQ instance:
```
curl http://localhost:8005/health
```
ForestMQ will respond with the following JSON response
```
{"queue_empty":true,"queue_length": 0,"status":"OK","request_start":"Sun Jul 28 18:59:44 2024\n","request_end":"Sun Jul 28 18:59:44 2024\n"}
```
